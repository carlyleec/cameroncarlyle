begins with modeling the world around us. Discrete features can be modeled as vectors (points, lines, and polygons), while continuous phenomenon like temperature and elevation can be modeled as rasters. Vector and raster data can be analyzed with spatial statistics using GIS to answer fundamental questions like, “Where’s the nearest coffee shop?” and “How do I get there from here?”. Geospatial analysis encompasses simple questions like these to more difficult questions that require complex models. More than anything, my graduate school education taught me how to perform geospatial analysis using both vector and raster data.  I’m an expert at using desktop GIS software like ArcMap and QGIS to perform geospatial analysis, and I am an expert at GIS programming using JavaScript, Python, and the totally awesome PostGIS extension for Postgres.\\n\\n### Enterprise GIS\\nIt’s really more like IT, and less like GIS. Modern enterprise geospatial architectures require an array of servers and databases.  I have experience creating, maintaining, and administrating a variety of enterprise GIS services, including: servers for hosting GIS layers on the web, deploying desktop GIS installations, and configuring spatially enabled databases to allow for the unique data editing requirements of GIS. I’ve setup and deployed instances of ESRI’s ArcGIS for Server. I have also worked with and administered ESRI’s ArcSDE on Postgres, including managing versions and database compression. I also have experience integrating enterprise GIS services into other enterprise systems, as well as working with ESRI’s ArcGIS Online.\\n\\n### Web Mapping\\nWeb mapping has a been a core component of my work for the last 4 years.   I’ve worked with Google Maps and Leaflet, and more recently I’ve been experimenting with Mapbox GL. I'm also really excited about Mapbox’s web GIS analysis toolset called Turf. In addition to client side mapping frameworks, I have experience with geospatial REST APIs like the ArcGIS REST API and GeoServer. I am completely comfortable working with data specifications like GeoJSON and the super awesome new(ish) Vector Tiles. I'm familiar with web GIS protocols like WMS and WFS, and I have built WMTS tile imagery services hosted on AWS S3 using GDAL. \\n\"\n\t};\n\n/***/ },\n/* 395 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\n\t\t\"attributes\": {},\n\t\t\"body\": \"### Databases\\nYou've got to store that application data somewhere, and more often than not, it's in a database. I have experience using both relational SQL databases and NoSQL databases. I’ve maintained and administered SQL databases from creating login roles to restricting databases access to certain machines through configuration files. I’ve primarily worked with Postgres, and I have a deep understanding of its more esoteric features. I have also worked with SQLServer, MySQL, and MongoDB.  I’m extremely comfortable with basic database operations like writing queries, inserting, updating, and deleting data, creating indexes, and normalizing data. I’m also a big fan of leveraging the power of SQL in SQL functions and stored procedures for handling complex data manipulations instead of offloading that complexity to the application code.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\nIn software applications and IT organizations, a database instance itself is often only a small component of a much larger data infrastructure of servers and ETL jobs. I have experience creating databases on cloud infrastructure like AWS EC2, AWS RDS and Heroku, as well as on local locally maintained servers. I understand the advantages and limitations of deploying databases in the cloud versus locally. I also have experience creating and maintaining ETL jobs using FME, Talend, Node.js, and some basic shell commands.  I have an excellent understanding of the organizational challenges that arise from complicated networks of ETL jobs in large organizations. I’m particularly excited about the potential of using micro-services like AWS Lambda to perform ETL type jobs on future projects.\\n\"\n\t};\n\n/***/ },\n/* 396 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\n\t\t\"attributes\": {},\n\t\t\"body\": \"In addition to geospatial analysis, I can also perform more traditional statistical analysis of datasets from standard summary to more complicated methods of hypothesis testing.

Values like simplicity and composability found in the Unix Philosophy are also key tenants in the Functional Programming paradigm, and my development style tends toward the Functional with a focus on pure functions, recursion, immutability, and using higher order functions. When necessary, I also make use of the Object Oriented paradigm to model objects with classes, encapsulate data access methods, and provide polymorphic interfaces. My approach to development is an iterative process driven by usability, where user testing is the measure that defines application performance.\\n\\n### Protocols, APIs and Architectures\\nWhether building or consuming APIs, HTTP is at the center of communication on the web. I have a deep understanding of HTTP and how it relates to building RESTful APIs for interacting with data. While REST APIs aren’t going away anytime soon, I think that GraphQL is the future of APIs, and I would encourage any new project to use GraphQL even if it is ultimately backed by a REST API. In addition, I’m familiar with a variety architectures, including client-server, multi-tier, and micro-services. I’m particularly excited about serverless micro-service architectures such as AWS’s Lambda for building REST and GraphQL APIs, as well performing maintenance tasks such as ETL jobs.\\n\"\n\t};\n\n/***/ },\n/* 401 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\n\t\t\"attributes\": {},\n\t\t\"body\": \"### Overview\\nI’ve been working primarily in JavaScript for the past 4 years. I have an excellent grasp of the classic JavaScript features like data types, functions, prototypical inheritance, and closures, as well as the more recent additions to the EcmaScript specification like the let and const keywords, lambda functions, Promises, generators, rest and spread operators, async/await, template literals, and deconstruction. As mentioned above, my development style tends toward the Functional, so I try keep my objects immutable and my functions pure, while making heavy use of higher-order functions like map, reduce, and filter. And I'll take unidirectional data flow over two-way binding any day.\\n\\n### Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools\\n\\nI use Yarn (and NPM) for package management, and I know how to configure ```package.json``` files for run tasks. I use Babel to transpile modern JavaScript to code browsers can actually use, and ESLint to make sure my syntax and formatting is consistent and correct. I've used both Grunt and Gulp as task runners in the past, but I've been using Webpack recently for it's code splitting features and rich ecosystem of loaders. Currently I'm using Atom as my text editor, but I've also been using VSCode recently as well.\\n\\n#### On the front-end\\nI've built front-end applications in Angular and React, and am interested in learning more about Vue and Ember. I really enjoy using Redux for handling UI state, and Redux-Sagas for handling asynchronous actions like HTTP requests. I also have experience using the Apollo Client to integrate GraphQL into client side applications. I've done client side routing with both React Router and AngularUI Router. Styled-components has really blown me away with its ability to cleanly add both style and structure to React apps.\\n\\n#### On the backend-end\\nI'm extremely comfortable building server side technologies with Node.js. I’ve built REST APIs in Express, and GraphQL API using GraphQL.

We approached the project similar to the way that we approached SimpliCity, we started with user research and a Business Model Canvas. Based on the business needs,  we decided to implement the site in Wordpress, and conducted several rounds of user testing along the way. While the site didn’t solve all the city’s communication problems, the city’s internal blog was a great success and the ever-elusive Travel Expense form was much easier to find due to a prominent (and working) search bar and a simplified layout.

Years went by and operating systems came and went, until one day Windows Server 2003 was no longer supported. A crisis ensued. The existing application code would not work on newer operating systems, so the entire app needed to be re-written, and everyone that had worked on project initially was gone. I had 2 weeks, and the city had mission critical business processes that depended on an API provided from the web application. Rather wasting time trying to properly configure a new Windows server, setup Postgres, and reimplement the existing .Net code, I decided to use Heroku. In a matter a minutes, I had a Postgres instance and a Node.js template app deployed. From there, I grabbed the complicated SQL bits from the existing application, and wrapped them in a lightweight API using Express that met the mission critical needs of the city. Finally, I added simple user interface with Handlebars for the public to interact with the API.

Discrete features can be modeled as vectors (points, lines, and polygons), while continuous phenomenon like temperature and elevation can be modeled as rasters. Vector and raster data can be analyzed with spatial statistics using GIS to answer fundamental questions like, “Where’s the nearest coffee shop?” and “How do I get there from here?”. Geospatial analysis encompasses simple questions like these to more difficult questions that require complex models. More than anything, my graduate school education taught me how to perform geospatial analysis using both vector and raster data.  I’m an expert at using desktop GIS software like ArcMap and QGIS to perform geospatial analysis, and I am an expert at GIS programming using JavaScript, Python, and the totally awesome PostGIS extension for Postgres.\\n\\n### Enterprise GIS\\nIt’s really more like IT, and less like GIS. Modern enterprise geospatial architectures require an array of servers and databases.  I have experience creating, maintaining, and administrating a variety of enterprise GIS services, including: servers for hosting GIS layers on the web, deploying desktop GIS installations, and configuring spatially enabled databases to allow for the unique data editing requirements of GIS. I’ve setup and deployed instances of ESRI’s ArcGIS for Server. I have also worked with and administered ESRI’s ArcSDE on Postgres, including managing versions and database compression. I also have experience integrating enterprise GIS services into other enterprise systems, as well as working with ESRI’s ArcGIS Online.\\n\\n### Web Mapping\\nWeb mapping has a been a core component of my work for the last 4 years.   I’ve worked with Google Maps and Leaflet, and more recently I’ve been experimenting with Mapbox GL. I'm also really excited about Mapbox’s web GIS analysis toolset called Turf. In addition to client side mapping frameworks, I have experience with geospatial REST APIs like the ArcGIS REST API and GeoServer. I am completely comfortable working with data specifications like GeoJSON and the super awesome new(ish) Vector Tiles. I'm familiar with web GIS protocols like WMS and WFS, and I have built WMTS tile imagery services hosted on AWS S3 using GDAL. \\n\"\n};\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/data/data/geospatial/markdown.md\n// module id = 394\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\n\t\"attributes\": {},\n\t\"body\": \"### Databases\\nYou've got to store that application data somewhere, and more often than not, it's in a database. I have experience using both relational SQL databases and NoSQL databases. I’ve maintained and administered SQL databases from creating login roles to restricting databases access to certain machines through configuration files. I’ve primarily worked with Postgres, and I have a deep understanding of its more esoteric features. I have also worked with SQLServer, MySQL, and MongoDB.  I’m extremely comfortable with basic database operations like writing queries, inserting, updating, and deleting data, creating indexes, and normalizing data. I’m also a big fan of leveraging the power of SQL in SQL functions and stored procedures for handling complex data manipulations instead of offloading that complexity to the application code.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\nIn software applications and IT organizations, a database instance itself is often only a small component of a much larger data infrastructure of servers and ETL jobs. I have experience creating databases on cloud infrastructure like AWS EC2, AWS RDS and Heroku, as well as on local locally maintained servers. I understand the advantages and limitations of deploying databases in the cloud versus locally. I also have experience creating and maintaining ETL jobs using FME, Talend, Node.js, and some basic shell commands.  I have an excellent understanding of the organizational challenges that arise from complicated networks of ETL jobs in large organizations.

Sketch App is my go-to tool for designing UI components from layouts and mockups to icons and graphics. I have some limited experience with the Adobe Suite, but haven’t used it enough to call myself an expert. I do have a good understanding of UI design concepts, and design guidelines like Google’s Material Design and Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines.

We worked together to build a web app to make it easier for citizens and city employees to access and interact with City maintained data, and we let users drive the development process. We started with user research, which involved sitting down with City staffers and asking them to show us how they answered questions from the public or used City data in their day-to-day jobs.\\n\\nAfter we took our initial guess at what we thought users wanted, we took our prototype to the local coffee shop and literally bribed folks with pastries to try our app.  We learned so much, and we used what we learned to improve the user experience. And we kept learning as we repeated the process with real estate agents, neighborhood association members, city employees, and more strangers in coffee shops. Every time we added new features, we went back to the users, and what we ended up was something pretty cool…  [SimpliCity: city data simplified](http://simplicity.ashevillenc.gov/#/search).

Values like simplicity and composability found in the Unix Philosophy are also key tenants in the Functional Programming paradigm, and my development style tends toward the Functional with a focus on pure functions, recursion, immutability, and using higher order functions. When necessary, I also make use of the Object Oriented paradigm to model objects with classes, encapsulate data access methods, and provide polymorphic interfaces. My approach to development is an iterative process driven by usability, where user testing is the measure that defines application performance.\\n\\n### Protocols, APIs and Architectures\\nWhether building or consuming APIs, HTTP is at the center of communication on the web. I have a deep understanding of HTTP and how it relates to building RESTful APIs for interacting with data. While REST APIs aren’t going away anytime soon, I think that GraphQL is the future of APIs, and I would encourage any new project to use GraphQL even if it is ultimately backed by a REST API. In addition, I’m familiar with a variety architectures, including client-server, multi-tier, and micro-services. I’m particularly excited about serverless micro-service architectures such as AWS’s Lambda for building REST and GraphQL APIs, as well performing maintenance tasks such as ETL jobs.\\n\"\n};\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/data/development/core/markdown.md\n// module id = 400\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\n\t\"attributes\": {},\n\t\"body\": \"### Overview\\nI’ve been working primarily in JavaScript for the past 4 years. I have an excellent grasp of the classic JavaScript features like data types, functions, prototypical inheritance, and closures, as well as the more recent additions to the EcmaScript specification like the let and const keywords, lambda functions, Promises, generators, rest and spread operators, async/await, template literals, and deconstruction. As mentioned above, my development style tends toward the Functional, so I try keep my objects immutable and my functions pure, while making heavy use of higher-order functions like map, reduce, and filter. And I'll take unidirectional data flow over two-way binding any day.\\n\\n### Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools\\n\\nI use Yarn (and NPM) for package management, and I know how to configure ```package.json``` files for run tasks. I use Babel to transpile modern JavaScript to code browsers can actually use, and ESLint to make sure my syntax and formatting is consistent and correct. I've used both Grunt and Gulp as task runners in the past, but I've been using Webpack recently for it's code splitting features and rich ecosystem of loaders. Currently I'm using Atom as my text editor, but I've also been using VSCode recently as well.\\n\\n#### On the front-end\\nI've built front-end applications in Angular and React, and am interested in learning more about Vue and Ember. I really enjoy using Redux for handling UI state, and Redux-Sagas for handling asynchronous actions like HTTP requests. I also have experience using the Apollo Client to integrate GraphQL into client side applications. I've done client side routing with both React Router and AngularUI Router. Styled-components has really blown me away with its ability to cleanly add both style and structure to React apps.\\n\\n#### On the backend-end\\nI'm extremely comfortable building server side technologies with Node.js. I’ve built REST APIs in Express, and GraphQL API using GraphQL.

The goals were to facilitate a two way conversion around key topics like wellness, leadership, and benefits, share stories through a blog, and make the Travel Expense form easier to find. We approached the project similar to the way that we approached SimpliCity, we started with user research and a Business Model Canvas. Based on the business needs,  we decided to implement the site in Wordpress, and conducted several rounds of user testing along the way. While the site didn’t solve all the city’s communication problems, the city’s internal blog was a great success and the ever-elusive Travel Expense form was much easier to find due to a prominent (and working) search bar and a simplified layout. One of the most popular features, was a searchable city directory complete with profile pictures so that you could put a name to that face in the elevator.

We approached the project like a startup, by conducting user research and creating a business model canvas to clearly define our value proposition. Then, we let users drive the development process. After we took our initial guess at what we thought users wanted, we took our prototype to the local coffee shop and literally bribed folks with pastries to try our app. We learned so much, and we used what we learned to improve the user experience. And we kept learning as we repeated the process with real estate agents, neighborhood association members, city employees, and more strangers in coffee shops.

The city and county both contributed code, and the university contributed a physical server.  The app worked great. Years went by and operating systems came and went, until one day Windows Server 2003 was no longer supported. A crisis ensued. The existing application code would not work on newer operating systems, so the entire app needed to be re-written, and everyone that had worked on project initially was gone. I had 2 weeks, and the city had mission critical business processes that depended on an API provided from the web application. Rather wasting time trying to properly configure a new Windows server, setup Postgres, and reimplement the existing .Net code, I decided to use Heroku. In a matter a minutes, I had a Postgres instance and a Node.js template app deployed. From there, I grabbed the complicated SQL bits from the existing application, and wrapped them in a lightweight API using Express that met the mission critical needs of the city. Finally, I added simple user interface with Handlebars for the public to interact with the API. Within a little over a week the new application was fully functional and deployed in place of the old app.\\n\\nCheck out the site, [here](http://www.mapwnc.org/).\\n\\nCheck out the code, [here](https://github.com/cityofasheville/coa-bc-steep-slope-calculator).\\n\"\n};\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/data/development/steepslope/markdown.md\n// module id = 406\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\n\t\"attributes\": {},\n\t\"body\": \"Graduate school is where I began learning to program.
