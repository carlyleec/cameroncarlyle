# cc-react

A React version of my portfolio website: [cameroncarlyle.com](https://www.cameroncarlyle.com)

It pulls data from this GraphQL endpoint: https://rlk7p3dxd8.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/production/graphql

You can play around with GraphQL API here: [cameroncarlyle.com/graphiql](https://www.cameroncarlyle.com/graphiql)

Getting Started

1. `git clone https://github.com/carlyleec/cc-react.git`
2. `yarn`
3. `npm start`

This will start a dev server running on http://localhost:3000.
